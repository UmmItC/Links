# Contribution Guidelines

## We Welcome Your Contributions!

We always welcome both issues and pull requests! When submitting a pull request (PR), please adhere to the Conventional Commits specification. Avoid using vague commit messages such as `update` or `some update`.

## Pull Request / Merge Request

I am happy to accept any commits or issues. However, if you want to contribute to the project, please do not commit without providing context. Explain what you did and why you did it :)

### Commit Style

**A good commit message is beneficial for yourself and others who may want to read it, and it will also be helpful for future reference.**

**Clean and descriptive commits are especially important as we use `semantic-release` to automate versioning and package publishing based on commit messages.**

For more information, please refer to the Conventional Commits specification: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Submission Process

Here is the process for submitting a merge request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch. (named as `dev` is ok)
3. Commit changes following the conventional commit style.
4. Push to your branch.
5. Open a Pull Request.
6. Use a clear and concise title; avoid phrases like 'PR request' or anything vague.
7. Please describe the changes you have made. I will review your code, but it is also important to provide context for developers.

Thank you for contributing!
