# Why My Name is UmmIt

The story behind my unique username and what it represents.

## The Origin

The name UmmIt actually came about quite randomly! I decided to remove the "co" from a previous name and add a "u" at the front, which transformed it into UmmIt

As someone who is dedicated to committing to my projects every day, this name reflects that commitment. Additionally, my passion for using Git and GNU/Linux ties into the name, making it a perfect representation of my identity in the tech world. :)
