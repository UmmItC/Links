# Introduction

The story behind this 'links' website and the motivation for its creation.

## The Inspiration

This website began as a personal initiative to organize my online presence and serve as a central hub for all my projects, thoughts, and digital footprint.

### Why?

Instead of relying on third-party platforms that donâ€™t offer full control over my content, I decided to build something from the ground up. While I was inspired by existing services like Linktree, I wanted to create a unique solution that truly reflects my vision. 

As someone who values efficiency and dislikes wasting time on unnecessary tasks, I took it upon myself to develop my own product. Thus, the concept of this links website was born.
