## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn package manager
- Supabase account (for analytics features)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmmItC/links.git
   cd links
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Setup Supabase:
   - Create a new project on [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/)
   - Create the required tables for analytics:

   <details>
   <summary>Click to expand SQL setup code</summary>

   ```sql
   -- Create tables if not exist
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS page_views (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     page_path TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS page_likes (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     page_path TEXT NOT NULL,
     user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     UNIQUE(page_path, user_id)
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   ALTER TABLE page_views ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE page_likes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Remove any existing policies
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to page_views" ON page_views;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert to page_views" ON page_views;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update to page_views" ON page_views;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow only incrementing views" ON page_views;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to page_likes" ON page_likes;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert to page_likes" ON page_likes;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to delete their own likes" ON page_likes;
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Prevent updating likes" ON page_likes;

   -- Create secure policies

   -- 1. Page views table policies
   -- Allow anyone to read
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to page_views" 
     ON page_views FOR SELECT 
     USING (true);

   -- Allow insertion
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert to page_views" 
     ON page_views FOR INSERT 
     WITH CHECK (true);

   -- Only allow incrementing view count (secure update)
   CREATE POLICY "Allow only incrementing views" 
     ON page_views FOR UPDATE 
     USING (true)
     WITH CHECK (view_count <= (SELECT view_count + 1 FROM page_views WHERE id = page_views.id));

   -- 2. Page likes table policies
   -- Allow anyone to read
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to page_likes" 
     ON page_likes FOR SELECT 
     USING (true);

   -- Allow inserting likes
   CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert to page_likes" 
     ON page_likes FOR INSERT 
     WITH CHECK (true);

   -- Allow deleting likes
   -- Note: We use client-side IDs instead of auth.uid()
   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete only their own likes" 
     ON page_likes FOR DELETE 
     USING (true);

   -- Prevent updating likes (likes can only be added or removed, not modified)
   CREATE POLICY "Prevent updating likes" 
     ON page_likes FOR UPDATE 
     USING (false);
   ```
   </details>

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:
   ```shell
   ❯ cp -v .env.example .env
   
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

5. View your site at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Production Build

Create a production-ready build:
```bash
yarn run build
```

Preview the production build:
```bash
yarn run preview
```

The static files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

This project includes automated deployment to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions workflows (see `.github/` directory).

Simply push your changes to the master branch, and the site will be automatically:

- Built
- Versioned
- Deployed

### Supabase Environment Variables

For GitHub Pages deployment, you need to add your Supabase credentials as GitHub repository secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add the following secrets:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve an issue
docs: update documentation
style: formatting changes
refactor: code restructuring
test: add/update tests
chore: maintenance tasks
```

### Branch Strategy

- `master`: Production-ready code (do not use this branch, since it's the Production branch)
- `dev`: Development and integration
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
