# Introduction

The story behind this 'links' website and the motivation for its creation.

## The Inspiration

This website began as a personal initiative to organize my online presence and serve as a central hub for all my projects, thoughts, and digital footprint.

### Why?

Instead of relying on third-party platforms that donâ€™t offer full control over my content, I decided to build something from the ground up. While I was inspired by existing services like Linktree, I wanted to create a unique solution that truly reflects my vision. 

As someone who values efficiency and dislikes wasting time on unnecessary tasks, I took it upon myself to develop my own product. Thus, the concept of this links website was born.

# Why My Name is UmmIt

The story behind my unique username and what it represents.

## The Origin

The name UmmIt actually came about quite randomly! I decided to remove the "co" from a previous name and add a "u" at the front, which transformed it into UmmIt

As someone who is dedicated to committing to my projects every day, this name reflects that commitment. Additionally, my passion for using Git and GNU/Linux ties into the name, making it a perfect representation of my identity in the tech world. :)`},{id:1,slug:"about_me/journey-of-my-learning-in-tech",filename:"about_me/journey-of-my-learning-in-tech.md",title:"My journey of my learning curve in Tech",date:"2025-03-17",lastmod:"2025-04-01",excerpt:"How I learned to embrace the tech world and my experiences...",tags:["personal","learning","tech"],content:`
